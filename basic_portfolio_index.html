          As the son and grandson of Mexican fieldworkers who came to the US without an education , Brian made an early decision in his career to ensure that individuals from socioeconomically disadvantaged communities have access to a quality education. With a decade of global leadership experience, Brian has worked across the world developing highly effective training and leadership development programs for young educators. With his newfound skill set in coding, Brian aspires to weave together his expertise and passion for education with the use of mobile technology.
